  **`createSlice`** and **`configureStore`** .

- The app supports CRUD operations, including adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. Users can also change a task's priority using the color picker and filter tasks based on their status

- Tasks are saved in **LocalStorage** to ensure persistence across page reloads.

- You can drag tasks wherever you want.
